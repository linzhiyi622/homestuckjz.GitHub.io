XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Thank you for just setting the most premium example of why that is the case right on top of the broken pedestal that is our shared ruined memories, in remembrance of the time when we had anything to do with each other's lives. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~+his a++i+ude is jus+ rich.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~you +hink I'm enjoying +his exchange in any conceivable way?~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Wow, your anger is still as disproportionate, misdirected and repetitive as it ever was and always will be! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Good to know we're barely a couple of messages in, yet already trampling on the same metaphorical roadkill that's been decaying on the pavement stretch for over two sweeps. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Haha, good times. Now tell me what the hell you've been going on about and also how you knew I was on the floor. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~oh righ+, because you are obviously doing so much BE++ER wi+h your own immodes+ opera+ion.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~A+ leas+ I'm consis+en+ wi+h my issues. ~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~All you've managed +o do is drag yourself appallingly deep in+o a gaping pi+ of men+al s+arva+ion and brassy language. ~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~so forgive me for +hinking +ha+ my bla+an+ dis+as+e is S+ILL beyond jus+ified a+ +his poin+.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~and I knew you were lazing on +he floor because I wen+ +hrough +he +rouble of going all +he way ou+ +o your middle-of-nowhere muckpuddle, once again choosing +o break your pa+he+ic ass.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~I'm abou+ +o bus+ +hrough your fron+ door and shove your disgus+ing maw +hrough +he fucking floorboards.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~+ha+ would be jus+ wha+ youd expec+ from me a+ +his poin+, im sure.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Decided +o MESSAGE you firs+ +o give you a nice HEADS UP. You're welcome.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Gee, thanks! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I'd really love to get the most out of your newfound enthusiasm for abrasive, tasteless jokes. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Give me a second to relish in this feeling and take it all in, it's like a whiff shot of tear gas. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~And I'd really love +o punch your face, bu+ i guess +ha+ would be repe+i+ive +oo, wouldn'+ i+.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD That was the lowest possible blow you could have taken. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD But I'm not going to devolve into hysterics over it this time, since you've made it pretty clear you don't care. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Plus, I've already got enough unexpected shit going on right now without having to throw YOU into the pot as well. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD What I'm dealing with is eerily close to what you just described, actually! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Some person popped up completely unannounced earlier, right by my hive, and then fucked off to who knows where. I was outside to investigate, and then I wasn't. I shouldn't have woken up inside my room! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Also my clothes are now inexplicably clean? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~UGH. who even CARES abou+ your clo+hes, arcjec???~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I do! They're special! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Look, I'm not pulling some sort of elaborate ruse or overblowing sleepwalking issues over here. I've got a serious memory gap, and it's not just because there's a LITERAL arrow insistently drilling right into my skull chasm. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD This thing's probably killing my knowledge cells as we speak, by the way. I can feel a headache incoming. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Well, maybe you should've pondered all +ha+ before you decided +o be a useless fuck and force me +o +ake ac+ion.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD So you're the one behind this. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Glad I managed to coax that out of you this soon. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~I +hough+ +ha+ was pre++y obvious by now.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD It sure wasn't! Because you don't SAY things, you BELLOW from the bottom of your chest cavity and shove your foot directly into anything you don't understand, without even thinking about the possibility of causing damage in the process. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD And whenever you DO formulate something, it's all just incomprehensible growling with an extra "fuck" thrown in as the ripe pincer on top. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~You hypocri+e.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Con+rary +o your assump+ion, I'm no+ doing +his jus+ +o spi+e you. ~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~+here's ac+ually some+hing serious going on for once in your miserable, cushy life.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~I wouldn'+ be was+ing +his much of my +ime wi+h you if +here wasn'+. ~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~or if i+ was some+hing i could avoid.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Oh, yeah? Is someone else also physically shoving you down and forcing you to look at a game screen, perchance? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Do we have an entire link chain of abstract symbol-based cursors holding us hostage in our own homes? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Because if that's the very specific case, then I totally and completely forgive you. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~migh+ as well be.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~I sure as shi+ can'+ do any+hing else wi+h +his game window +aking over my en+ire compu+er.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~+ha+ plus all +he o+her obscure, doom slinging ins+ruc+ions I've received +onigh+ drives a pre++y hard and ANNOYING poin+.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~jus+ like +he one I hope I've managed +o dig in+o your head by now.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Wan+ed +o make sure you ac+ually S+AYED PU+ and lis+ened +o me, because I had +o prod a+ your puny, lanky body and wa+ch you snore for several minu+es, which was also annoying.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~so im giving myself +his +iny bi+ of sa+isfac+ion.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I'll admit that was a good call. Given the chance, I would absolutely be as far away as possible from this spot by now. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD What sort of doom is being slinged around, though? There's literally nothing out of the ordinary going on. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I mean in my case, maybe. With the obtrusions of third parties such as yourself and the puzzling autonomous reallocation of my unconscious body and such. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD But other than that, this night is as drab as any other. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I'm astounded that your fuming indignation at our little talk apparently made you forget that you're the one putting this game into motion in the first place. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD You can just stop at any point and let the rest of today run its course. Get your computer checked out later. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD And I don't know about you, but I'd rather have one less weird thing to worry about tonight if I can help it. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Especially if it's one involving you. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I already learned my lesson there. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Were you really ou+ of i+ for +ha+ fucking long?~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~"Memory gap" doesn'+ even BEGIN +o describe +he problem, +hen.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~Considering I dragged you over here fresh ou+ of your ignoran+ bliss, I'm sure you didn'+ ge+ a look a+ +he ex+ensive message Murri+ sen+ everyone.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~no+ going +o was+e even more of my +ime +rying repea+ any of his confusing gibberish.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~im sure you can handle +ha+ much if you value your life.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~and if you can'+, +hen ge+ ready. ~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~because you're abou+ +o anyway.~</span><br></div></div></span></div>
