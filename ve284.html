That information stays between me and myself. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Besides, didn't I JUST go over the fact that the papers are, you know. Important? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Maybe I just felt like treating them with a bit more respect, since I initially disregarded their intrinsic value. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Don't quote me on this, but I've heard it's healthy and normal to feel legitimately sorry about things. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD You know what, I better apologize. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I'm sorry, papers. Truly, I overlooked your rightful place in this operation. It's not about the way you rest on the floor in a sad heap â€” it's in the way you bind yourself to this awful predicament that we find ourselves in. Together. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD And I respect you playing the part of peacekeeper in these trying times. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Just between us two, I think Taz is being more than a little unfair right now. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD You don't deserve that callous treatment. Nobody deserves that. Except for me, obviously. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Shhh, it's okay. I don't mind taking the weight of your markings on my back. You're in good hands now that I've established a mock dialogue with you. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~wow, alrigh+.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~+hanks for +he fucking deluge of ye+ more useless derision.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~All of +ha+ was EX+REMELY relevan+ and EXAC+LY wha+ we needed +o help us figure +his ou+.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~I'm sure +he PAPERS apprecia+e your kind ac+ions and considera+ion.~</span><br><span style="color: #39017F;">PO: ~bu+ jus+ as a +hough+, maybe poli+ely asking +hem wha+ you should be doing from +he ge+ go would make your life easier nex+ +ime.~</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I'm not sure how willing they are to open up at this point. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Maybe it would be best if YOU asked them politely, since you can both see and hear us having this very real conversation in very real time. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD I know, right? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Sorry, talking to the papers.

XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Or better yet. Let me apologize to you for this attempt to lighten up a situation which I have had NO control over so far and was quite literally dragged into against my will, on what is turning out to be the second worst day of my regrettable spawning, only to be greeted with none other than the ONE person who I never wanted to hear death rattle on her keyboard at me again. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Oh, yeah! And I'm apparently about to die, unless I follow either your screeching directions or the ravings of an incomprehensible slam jockey with more exposed RGB wires than common decency. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Can't forget about that! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD So, please EXCUSE me for trying to keep my spirits up in the midst of your rampaging temper tantrums, as you just yell the same things over and over and OVER again and act like I'm incapable of understanding even the most rudimentary of concepts! XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Do you want me to fucking GROVEL at your feet and THANK you for the molten irradiated core that is your CATASTROPHIC ANGER, as if that's not been a haunting specter constantly LOOMING over me for all these sweeps? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD DO YOU WANT ME TO GET RESULTS, or do you want to continue WASTING YOUR TIME by saying that I'M WASTING MINE??? XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD This is a two way rostrum that you and I are barely standing on. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD So, if you want something done the YOU way, by all means. Take it to your own personal floor. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD But as far as MY side of the podium is concerned, I'll keep doing things MY way. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD And if I absolutely have to, I'll make sure to meet you right smack dab in the middle axis in order to ensure our continued survival. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD But once this is over, don't you fucking dare think I'm going to keep this little lambasting act up. XDXD</span><br><span style="color: #B95C00;">AH: XDXD Once I'm out of here, we're done. XDXD</span><br></div></div></span></div>
